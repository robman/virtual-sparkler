# Virtual Sparkler

I created this WebAI toy with Gemini and a few smart prompts to get the design and UX right.

- It uses [WebAI for the hand tracking](https://ai.google.dev/edge/mediapipe/solutions/vision/hand_landmarker/web_js)
- [Three.js](https://threejs.org/) for the effects
- You can try it for yourself here [TrustIndex.today/sparkler/](https://TrustIndex.today/sparkler/)
- Or use the code yourself - it's Open Source on github [https://github.com/robman/virtual-sparkler](https://github.com/robman/virtual-sparkler)

# Software is ephemeral now

This is a fun way to bring in the new year, but it's also a good example of a broader transformation that's happening.

More and more disposable or ephemeral software is being created using agentic coding and the web is the perfect way to deliver this.

But underneath this transformation is a bigger question. 

> *"If everything's changing faster & faster, what can you rely on?"*

On January 1st, 2026 I'll be launching my new project that attempts to answer this question and track the impacts - check it out at the [TrustIndex.today](https://TrustIndex.today).
